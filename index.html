					<h3 id="head">My experience with Tonsillectomy: I definitely just died and came back to life</h3>
					<div id="post_info">
					<h5 id="author"> written by clara lee | <em id="date">Posted on January 5, 2018</em> </h5>
					</div>
					
					<p> This winter break has been by far the most painful. I arrived in San Diego, spent three days with my family and friends, and got a tonsillectomy. I had scheduled this appointment back in July in a hurry to get it done, to get my tonsils out for good. 
					</p>
					<p> I had been struggling with tonsillitis, as well as trouble breathing, for a couple years, and decided that I had to finally do something about it. 
					</p>
					<p> December 19th came around quickly, and I went in for the quick surgery. As fast as the surgery was (roughly 20 minutes), I ended up recovering for two-three weeks before I could comfortably swallow again. 
					</p>
					<p> The first 11 days were the worst. I couldn't drink water or eat because of the pain, resulting in a weight loss of 10 pounds. I was on a combination of narcotics and acetaminophen during that time, as well as Aleve to aid with ear pain (turns out your ears are connected to the tendons around your tonsils...), for 11 days. I would take the pills every 4-6 hours, and wake up in searing pain if I exceeded that time frame. 
					</p>
					<p> I was bed ridden from the drowsy side effects that come with such medications, causing my legs (and overall body) to weaken and lose muscle. </p>
					<p>After 10 days, my parents took me to a Korean hospital, where I got two bags of IV fluids and nutrients (honestly, not really sure what they pumped into me), and I emerged alive and new. I could finally swallow and talk, and began my quick ascent into the world of food and water. It was pretty awesome and incredible. 
					 </p>
					 <p> After getting off of the narcotics on day 13, I was able to drive around and try to live up the rest of my winter break, despite my lack of energy, muscles to walk around with, and voice. I slowly began eating the foods I had wanted to eat when bedridden (when I had watched every single Tasty video that exists...). 
					 </p>
					 <p> Now that I'm almost completely healed, I have met up with friends, eaten food (albeit only a little, considering my shrunken stomach), and successfully slept without waking up from lack of breath. I'm hoping that as the days go on, the horrible aftermath of the surgery will be worth the pain. 
					 </p>
					 <p> I definitely do not recommend getting the surgery when you don't have a lot of time to just be dead, because functioning when on all the medication, and when lacking actual energy, is near impossible. Good luck to anyone out there who needs to get the surgery...I'm sure it'll be worth it in the end.

					<h3 id="head">New Year New Me: Sunrise Yoga</h3>
					<div id="post_info">
					<h5 id="author"> written by clara lee | <em id="date">Posted on January 13, 2018</em> </h5>
					</div>
					
					<p> I used to rock climb a lot. Like, 4-5 times a week a lot. But after a semester off because of a rough schedule, I am finding it difficult to get back into it. I feel like I'm in a rut that I can't escape. It is so difficult to get back to something that is energy draining (and not to mention, difficult to access without a car) when taking difficult classes. I know that this semester will be almost equally hard and extremely important to my success at Berkeley, so I decided to take a break, instead of feeling guilty for not giving climbing enough time in my busy life. </p>

					<p> As a replacement, though, I decided to get back into doing yoga regularly. Today was day one of this new resolution, and I woke up at 6:15 to  get to a 7 AM yoga class. I was mildly hungover from a night out with old friends, but as my sister kept telling me, "Yoga is the hangover cure." As the class went on, I could feel the remains of alcohol slowly sweating out of my system, and my limbs and body felt more in line with a healthy lifestyle. Very refreshing. </p>
					<p> I'm really glad that my first day was a good experience, because it makes me want to continue practicing yoga. Classes start tomorrow, so I know that my morale and desire to do anything else outside of studying will be low. I need to make sure that I stay devoted to this new lifestyle! I'm excited for the end of this semester, already, just to look back and see how far I will have (hopefully) come. </p>
